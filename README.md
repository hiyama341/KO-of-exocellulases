# Data Repository for: The knockout of exocellulases results in a fungal enzymatic cocktail useful to produce oligosaccharides from pretreated sugarcane straw

This repository contains data and a Jupyter notebook that examines how the sequences for the Aspergillus mutants were found and retrieved.


## Data
The data in this repository includes:

- An excel file of the Aspergillus mutant strains and their corresponding identifiers
- Differentially expressed genes for each strain.
- Genome sequences - were obtained from FungiDB and are provided in gb format.

## Jupyter Notebook

The Jupyter notebook in this repository, Aspergillus_Mutants.ipynb, examines how the DNA sequences for the Aspergillus mutants were found and retrieved. The notebook includes code and explanations for:

- Querying the databases to identify the Aspergillus mutants and their corresponding DNA sequences
- Processing the DNA sequences to fasta files

The notebook has detailed explanation of each each step of the analysis.

## Usage
To use this repository and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries, which are listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Open the Aspergillus_Mutants.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or a similar environment.
4. Run the code cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and generate any desired output.
