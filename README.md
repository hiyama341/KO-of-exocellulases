# Data Repository for Aspergillus Mutants
This repository contains data and a Jupyter notebook that examines how the sequences for the Aspergillus mutants were found and retrieved. The mutants are strains of the Aspergillus fungus that have been genetically modified for research purposes.

## Data
The data in this repository includes:

- An excel file of the Aspergillus mutant strains and their corresponding identifiers
- The DNA sequences for each mutant strain
- The genome sequences were obtained from FungiDB and are provided in gb format.

## Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter notebook in this repository, Aspergillus_Mutants.ipynb, examines how the DNA sequences for the Aspergillus mutants were found and retrieved. The notebook includes code and explanations for:

- Querying the databases to identify the Aspergillus mutants and their corresponding DNA sequences
- Processing the DNA sequences to remove any non-coding regions or other extraneous information
- Analyzing the sequences to identify any common features or mutations that may be relevant for research purposes


The notebook has detailed explanation of each each step of the analysis.

## Usage
To use this repository and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python libraries, which are listed in the requirements.txt file.
3. Open the Aspergillus_Mutants.ipynb notebook in Jupyter or a similar environment.
4. Run the code cells in the notebook to reproduce the analysis and generate any desired output.
